### An Implementation of Distributed Maximal Independent Set with MPICH (DMIS-MPICH)
***

This program is an implemention of [Luby's algorithm](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/0215074) , which finds a maximal independent set distributedly. The program is written by _Hasan Heydari_ with `c++` language and [MPICH library](https://www.mpich.org/).
